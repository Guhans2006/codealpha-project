Phishing Awareness Training is a digital education module designed to help individuals recognize and defend against phishing attacks, one of the most common cybersecurity threats today. This training module aims to raise awareness about how phishing works, the techniques attackers use, and how to safely identify and respond to suspicious communications. It covers various forms of phishing, including deceptive emails, malicious websites, social engineering tactics, smishing (SMS phishing), and vishing (voice phishing). Users will learn how to spot red flags such as fake email addresses, suspicious links, poor grammar, and urgent requests for sensitive information. The training includes real-life examples, visual comparisons of legitimate vs. phishing emails and websites, interactive quizzes to test knowledge, and a checklist of best practices to stay secure online. By completing this training, individuals will gain the skills needed to protect their personal and organizational data, report phishing attempts, and contribute to a more secure digital environment. This project is ideal for students, employees, or anyone who uses email or the internet regularly and wants to enhance their cybersecurity awareness.
